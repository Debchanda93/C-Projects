Pointers:

Two ways to store a variable: STACK and HEAP.

Usually they are stored as STACK. When functions are written, it allocates variable in the STACK. After function is over, it deallocates the variables. 
HEAP allows the variable to stay.

Pointer pointing to NULL is a safety net. Whenever we dont have value to point to, the pointer should point to NULL. 

Pointers are usefull for allocating HEAP-DYNAMIC MEMORY and pointing towards it. MEMORY LEAK is when the pointer (pointing to the heap-dynamic memory) is lost. 
DOUBLE DELETE will crash the program. So be careful. 
Deleting NULL Pointer has no effect.
